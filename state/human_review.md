# Human review queue

## Current workflow gate

- next node: `node_a`
- status: `ready_for_node_a`
- round loop: `round 65/100` with `36` rounds remaining

## Direction approval policy

- explicit approval: `python scripts/graph.py approve --direction dir_02`
- select the top frontier candidate: `python scripts/graph.py select-next`
- continue with recommended direction: `python scripts/graph.py use-recommended-direction`
- node_c should implement exactly one selected direction

## Latest diagnosis

- diagnosis id: `auto_diagnosis_round_065`
- diagnosis status: `completed`
- recommended direction: `dir_01`
- approved direction: `None`
- diagnosis notes: `Auto-generated round 65 diagnosis. Recommended family: legacy::restore_accepted_grouped_rows_8_hot_band_consumer_ordering.`
- dir_01: Restore Accepted Grouped-Rows-8 Hot-Band Consumer Ordering | bottleneck: A branch-local hot-band scheduling or geometry bottleneck on the dominant kernel path, rather than a pure restore-only action.
- dir_02: Restore The Best Measured PTX Grouping Window On The Accepted Surface | bottleneck: Search drift away from the accepted PTX steady state rather than a missing structural opportunity.
- dir_03: Promote The Existing 256x128 Pivot Hot-Band Kernel | bottleneck: A branch-local hot-band scheduling or geometry bottleneck on the dominant kernel path, rather than a pure restore-only action.

## Active direction

- selected direction: `dir_01`
- selection mode: `recommended`
- status: `implemented_pending_measurement`
- notes: `Build passed. Node A must measure this implementation next.`
