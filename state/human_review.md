# Human review queue

## Current workflow gate

- next node: `node_c`
- status: `ready_for_node_c`
- round loop: `round 44/100` with `57` rounds remaining

## Direction approval policy

- explicit approval: `python scripts/graph.py approve --direction dir_02`
- select the top frontier candidate: `python scripts/graph.py select-next`
- continue with recommended direction: `python scripts/graph.py use-recommended-direction`
- node_c should implement exactly one selected direction

## Latest diagnosis

- diagnosis id: `auto_diagnosis_round_044`
- diagnosis status: `completed`
- recommended direction: `dir_01`
- approved direction: `None`
- diagnosis notes: `Auto-generated round 44 diagnosis. Recommended family: legacy::restore_the_best_measured_ptx_grouping_window_on_the_accepted_surface.`
- dir_01: Restore The Best Measured PTX Grouping Window On The Accepted Surface | bottleneck: Search drift away from the accepted PTX steady state rather than a missing structural opportunity.
- dir_02: Port Grouped-Row Traversal Into The Non-PTX 128x128 Sibling | bottleneck: A branch-local hot-band scheduling or geometry bottleneck on the dominant kernel path, rather than a pure restore-only action.
- dir_03: Port Grouped-Row Traversal Into The Non-PTX 128x128 Sibling | bottleneck: A branch-local hot-band scheduling or geometry bottleneck on the dominant kernel path, rather than a pure restore-only action.

## Active direction

- selected direction: `dir_01`
- selection mode: `recommended`
- status: `ready_for_implementation`
- notes: `Node C may now implement this one candidate.`
